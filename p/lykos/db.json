We also came up with beautiful innovation called SEED Pencils-These Pencils are 100% bio-degradable and made from recycled paper and old newspapers. Instead of an eraser, each pencil has a seed capsule on one end. The capsule contains herbs like basil etc Once the writing end of the pencil is all used up, you just stick the capsule end in some soil and water regularly. The seed should germinate within 1 to 3 weeks.",

This energy is used to recharge the battery on the go thereby adding to the vehicles running range. Thus, faster the vehicle, more the number miles added. So far, the test results have shown that an impressive enhancement of up to 60% in vehicle range(at an average speed of 50 mph for an hour with a standard battery size of 60kWh).

But 99.99% of our bakery is made from ultra-processed white flour aka Maida, transfats, and numerous chemicals which reportedly cause various lifestyle diseases. Just so you know, every 12th Indian is a diabetic, and more than 2.7 million Indians die of heart diseases every year \u2013 52 percent of them below the age of 70. As a typical chai-biscuit lover, we wanted to rehabilitate Indian bakery vis a vis reducing the disease burden using our technical know-how of nutrition science, food technology, and traditional wisdom. Ancient grains aka Millets came across as the best bet as they contain 2x more Protein, 5x more Fibre, and 8x more Calcium than wheat. Millets reportedly reduce 30% risk of Cancers, 20% risk of heart disease & 19% risk of blood sugar. Millets are also incredibly environment friendly, take 80% less water than wheat & require no chemical other input to grow. Therefore, we founded Bazic in 2019 to build a 'crop to cookie' model, connecting agri-scientists, marginal farmers, and food scientists to develop delicious comfort foods like Bajra brownies, bajra choco chip cookies, jowar nankhatai etc.",

We are currently developing cityretails.com where user can enroll their store and sell their products online and offline. They can also sell on amazon.in and other eCommerce websites through our platform. Main reason why these big players are successful because they have range of products with heavy discounts but there are some drawbacks with them like fake product delivered or communication gap. But with cityretails, when shopkeeper send their products to customers, they can immediate confirm if anything wrong with the product and delivery time is within 24 hours which is not possible for big companies in small cities. We are almost done with this project and we are now integrating with GST API. We can give more details in further discussion.",

        "description": "The world is aging and growing older. It is also doing so at a brisk pace. Closer home in India, the population of 60 years and above is expected to soon constitute around 20% of the total population. In 2021, the 60 Plus Population is estimated to be 138 Millon. On aggregate, the elderly population is projected to have risen by 32.7% between 2011 to 2021, even as the the general population has risen by 12.4% during the same period. With better facilities and a rationalization of prices, a trend of \u201cvoluntary retirement\u201d at around age 50 is also catching up nowadays. This population clubbed with the Senior Citizen population based on the traditional age criteria forms a significant chunk of consumers. In terms of purchasing power this translates into an opportunity of USD 12 Billion or INR 84 Lakh Crore. However, products and services designed and targeting this segment are few and far between. Majority of Service Providers are focused on Health Care and Nursing Care for this segment which constitutes roughly 10% - 15% of the total segment at best. Apart from products and services, ageing, in its wake brings its own peculiar challenges. These range from isolation resulting from changing family structures to lack of connect with same age group and many more social issues. NjoyUrAge is looking to provide comprehensive solution to address these challenges. NjoyUrAge is a web and app platform positioned to be the Go-To solution for the 50 Plus population and resolve the segments needs for engagement, leisure and learning. We are intent to radically transform the market by providing services and products designed specifically for senior citizens. We intend to do so by creating the largest community of Older Adults through constant engagement and activity. Leveraging mobile and web apps we are creating the largest community of Older Adults. Some of the features of these are: 1. Connect: Intended to enable seniors to connect & engage online. The users can create polls, hold forum discussions, share anecdotes & have one to one chat with other users registered on the platform. 2. Community Connect: This provides for creation of localized communities of Seniors who share a common interest such as a hobby or an activity. It also enables the seniors to give back to the society by connecting them to NGO\u2019s or by enabling their participation in socially relevant activities such as a cleanliness drive or a plantation drive. 3. Events: Intended to foster social mingling \u2013 online and offline - amongst the seniors by organizing & hosting curated & specialized events for the Seniors. These may be Theatre Shows, Yoga Seminars or a community specific event. 4. Health & Fitness: The dedicated section on Health & Fitness contains curated videos & articles on \u2018Positivity\u2019, \u2018Spirituality\u2019 as well as relevant information on common health issues afflicting the age group. Also connects to Service Providers rendering services such as Yoga, Physiotherapy & Physical Training. 5. Xplore: Xplore is dedicated to activities & travel. This contains information on Travel such as Destinations, Experiential Travel as well as enables booking of Travel & Tour Packages. The section also has information on Nutrition such as Recipes for the Age Group. 6. Services: Registered users may use this to book service provided by a curated set of Service Providers. The services rendered are designed basis the needs and requirements of the seniors. Services which shall be provided include Optician at Home,Hobby Classes & Home Refurbishing. The target users are at the centre of work done at NjoyUrAge. Our platforms are tailored to suit the requirements of this segment. 1. The entire setup & structure of NjoyUrAge is tailored & curated for the particular age segment. Content is specifically designed for the target segment. 2. Events/ Activities & tour packages shall be designed keeping in mind the constraints & special requirements of the Seniors. 3. Services which are being developed are designed to be of use of the particular-age segment. 4. The focus of the entire setup is on infusing positivity to the process of aging. 5. An engagement & constructive occupation of the seniors that will bring a change in the daily lives of seniors. The concept of NjoyUrAge revolves around socialization with emphasis on engagement and connection. An approach that largely dwells into the software piece of aging than the hardware bit, makes the entire community of elders think through ageing and its challenges, differently. An orientation to create an user-friendly eco-system for the ageing community --- build around their aspirations rather than the generic support/helping orientation for ageing Most of the service providers in this domain are largely focussed on supplying supporting hardware in a E-market place environment for elderlies, and do not dwell into the critical aspects of engagement & occupation and building a community --- which is the core focus of NjoyUrAge NjoyUrAge can alter the way aging is looked at in India & the rest of the world. Independence, confidence, and agility brought to the lives of elderlies.",

Jaipur being a tier II city has a fair number of corporates as well as middle-class households as a potential customer base. Corporates encounter challenges of unregistered vendors, lack of paperwork, and customer support (during or post-service) for residential clients. \u201cWe see a huge requirement for annual maintenance contracts/ subscription models in technical maintenance services for corporate clients with multiple city location offices. These corporates present an immense opportunity to expand geographically and provide a recurring stream of income. If tapped properly, one can acquire new projects and build a loyal customer base as an add-on business. Technical service base business has certainly a huge market,\u201d explicates Anirudh. From where it all Started Just after completion of B.Tech \u2013 Electrical, Anirudh and Bharat got placed in MNCs. Thereafter, they began looking for commercializing their technical skills for creating value. They decided to come up with an engineering firm to set a roadmap for those graduating with a technical background and have some business acumen or want to get self-employed. \u201cBharat is well versed in computers & IT and branding while Anirudh handles administration and sales. We complement each other\u2019s attributes, which is a demand for a multifaceted business like us. Choosing a non-competitive business model with respect to those MNCs in which we use to work was also an advantage as we were not conditioned and started everything from nothing,\u201d mentions Anirudh. \"We believe building a brand doesn\u2019t take million it takes imagination and lifetime dedication\" At the start, it was difficult to connect with technicians and modulate their way of working; eventually, an in-house team of 20+ technicians and 70+ associates (off role) technical staff were formed. \u201cFor managing this team and database of 40-50 leads on a daily basis, we have developed customized ERP software which has evolved after several trial and errors. Now, we are planning to license out this valuable process in a franchise format,\u201d. Apart from these backend developments, the company has managed to accomplish large-scale projects with Shobha Ltd., Amazon, Uber India system, Dunes Harley, Larsen & Toubro, Godrej, and a few govt. tech-based projects. It has served 10,000+ customers and 70-80 Subscription contracts in different A-List companies too. The company operates in four kinds of formats simultaneously \u2013 retail business leads which include quick maintenance services such as a plumber, electrician carpenters, air conditioner and electronics repair, pest control, water proofing and fabrication work; recurring nature of contracts like AMC, installation of products; large scales volume projects such as renovation, revamp, complete structural civil work, and consumable inventory items for industries and offices such as fire extinguishers, biometric, CCTV, and its accessories, different dispensers and furnishing items such as blinds, industrial curtains, amongst others. \"Bharat Sharma Co-Founder\" & \"Anirudh Sharma Co-Founder\" Stepping Forward into Growth Mr. Repair has been growing organically for the past five years; it has crossed revenue of 3 cr in the last financial year. It was awarded as \" TOP 10 STARTUP IN JAIPUR \" in 2019 by silicon India Magazine and was featured in your story. With registered vendors for big corporates like JLL, L&T, Amazon, Uber India, and chains of clinics and restaurants in 10+ cities of India including Indore, Bhopal, Lucknow, Delhi, and Chandigarh. The team is currently building an eminent online presence and is all set for the franchise model. \u201cThe goal is to distribute franchisees across 100 cities in the next three years through hub and spokes model each having standardized process, revenue stream, backend tech support, and centralized marketing campaigns. \u201cWe are also forming a routine auditing mechanism for governing such large operations and cash flow. We would start accepting the application for the same by June of next year,\u201d Started with an entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to solve the problem in one of the most unorganized sectors with minimal Investments, It has been growing organically and profitably since its first year.

We\u2019ll try our best to provide the desirable services to the customer satisfaction. As we are not even in the market but still if gets that opportunity then we will rock the market with the talent we got. What will we provide? We will provide the services like gym membership, spa and saloon booking at visit or home, medical consultancy, prescribed medicines, healthcare and beauty products, home care(nurses at home, mother and baby care) packages, healthcare insurance and else we can add some more in future as need increase. Visit www.kuriens.com How we will do this? We will at first contact the local dealers to supply for us by reaching out to the company too for the exclusive products and direct buying. And for services we contact the service providers at first to deliver services for us and then soon as we grow we will insure that those services will also be available by our name too. What about the revenue? It\u2019s completely a commission based business model at start stage. A commission ranging from 10-20% will be charged by the service and product suppliers. Once we have our own services we can have better revenue options. As we do not need to buy services from outsiders and products bought from dealers tough we can buy them directly from the company and storing them is warehouses. Company\u2019s growth and future aspects. Stay true to the core purpose when scaling our business, never take our eye off of what got us there in the first place. Stay true to our vision, and make sure everyone else does too. The decisions we make during this time of rapid market growth we need to connect back to why we started our company. Develop a new mission although we're sticking to a core purpose, we'll need to chart a very clear course for the future. Map out our goals and assign a timeline, so we know exactly what we need to achieve after one quarter, one year and so on. By asking every team member to work toward very specific milestones, we are able to grow in an intentional way. When creating a mission for our company, we make sure mission goals are measurable so we know which activities and initiatives will deliver the desired results. Be very picky with new opportunities as our company's stature grows, expect a slew of opportunities at our doorstep. Most of them won't be worth it. This is the time to stay focused on our customers and wow them at every opportunity. It can be easy to get distracted from our customers with all these new opportunities coming our way, but we remember, if we don't have customers, we don't have a business. Spending time and energy on opportunities that don't align with our customers' needs is just a distraction. Focus on cash in the door as our company grows quickly; invest in sales and marketing strategies that will continue to pay off over time. Seek out partnerships and systems that will produce for years to come, not just one-off deals for the sake of a quick buck. Get our priorities straight during a period of rapid growth; we know how important it is to stay true to the company's vision. But it's more complicated than that. Founders and CEOs need to have an ability to step back and get the overall lay of the land. Things can change rapidly, and it's very important to evaluate whether the way we spend our time is aligned with our ultimate purpose. Do the goals we originally outlined still serve our company, and are we and our team spending time and resources on the things that will enable us to achieve our goals? Get everyone behind our vision by reach out to our staff, partners and customers, and invite them to share in our vision. People love to play on the winning team, and if our company is taking off, use the positive momentum to our advantage. It's an invigorating experience and so many people walk away with a desire to be part of our company's success. Hire, train (and fire) to our vision by understanding that every person we hire will either strengthen or weaken our culture. That's a tough lesson to learn, but deep down we all know it's true. Consider applicants in terms of their personality and fit, and train them through an on boarding experience that reflects our culture. Look for contributors who are motivated both by the company purpose and a genuine enjoyment of what they do. On the flip side, we can't be afraid to fire people based on patterns of violating our company's values or poor performance. As difficult as it may seem at the time, there's no doubt our company will be better for it in the long run. Guiding a company through a period of rapid growth comes with a slew of challenges. In time, we won't be worried about growing a startup--we'll be running a large company. And that\u2019s for sure.",

Today, the clay brick industry consumes 350 million tons of fertile soil and 25 million metric tons of coal, releases toxic gases and making it highly unsustainable industry. Even the central pollution control board is planning to shut down these brick kilns. To address the issue with value chain of brick industry, We are developing eco-friendly, lightweight and dampproof bricks, as an alternative for unsustainable clay bricks industry. Wricks weighs 1Kg lesser and has the compressive strength equivalent to Class-A clay bricks. It is being tested with govt. accredited NABL (National accreditation board for testing and calibration laboratory) laboratory on the Indian standard {IS 3495 (Part 1-4) : 1992} tests. Wricks has demonstrated working performance with mortar test and temperature variation through a wall testing made of it. We achieved this using our proprietary composition comprising recycled plastic waste and inert waste (Construction waste, marble slurry, mining stone waste) as well as proprietary technology. We are a team of civil engineers and shareholder from a real estate background with more than 100 years of accumulative experience. Our objective is to provide a sustainable alternative to Rs. 1800 Crore Indian brick industry, while reducing waste management burden of society.",

We will use techniques like 3D Designing, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence for all our franchisees and for the various processes of projects for artificial intelligence. In the construction industry, the main problem is that people are not using the latest technical solutions for rapid construction and distribution of projects. Techniques like 3D Designing, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence can be used for distribution of various projects and projects.We are working on a model where we can speed up the buildings using 3D-designed technology. and Due to our geographical variations here, houses scattered in mountains, hills, rivers, forests, wetlands, deserts and remote areas are distinguished. Apart from this, there is a wide range of available sub-grade soil types, rainfall, traffic patterns and availability of building materials. These natural barriers cause problems to develop a standard similar technique to meet the requirements on all sites. For this it is necessary to adopt various techniques based on site specific circumstances. We will do direct road and other construction projects using the latest technologies. There are conditions in many places where the prescribed standards are not available in normal Leeds, which results in long haulage and more cost. If locally available material is used along with marginal and industrial waste materials, then it may be possible to reduce the cost of construction. However, The use of new materials and technologies is not being popular due to some procedural constraints as well as lack of awareness, and therefore, it may have to take appropriate steps to popularize new technologies for better construction with lower costs. By adopting such technology, conservation of natural resources, energy environment can also be done. We will use the latest technology for the construction of the government by using the industrial waste material and locally available material to meet the cost of production in less cost than other companies, which will also benefit the government and construct workers.

We are also using the internships as a crowdsourcing platform. Now, we have a franchise model as well, we call them FACE (Foxmula Authorized Center of Excellence). It works by making existing Training Centers/Institutes onboard Foxmula and rebrand themselves with Foxmula. That\u2019s how we get to convert Traditional crowd as well, who are not comfortable with e-learning. It\u2019s not just our Franchise model that makes us stand out, but also our exclusive service FoxmulaX, with a Guaranteed job. A FoxmulaX learner, not just pays a monthly fee for the subscribed period, which varies from 3-12 months, but also 17% of their base salary for two years. Here is small math, with a FoxmulaX batch of just 600 learners, revenue of $1.5 million USD can be generated in 12 months. This whole model of Foxmula (e-learning/Offline learning/FoxmulaX/Crowdsourcing), can change how the world perceives Education, learning, and Workforce. Right now, we are exploring ways to speed up our expansion and implement our model on a bigger scale. In 10 months, we have over 10,000 users, out of which 3500+ are paid users. This prooves demand & urgency. We look forward to crossing a million figure by 2021.",

To fulfill this purpose, the clay used to make Mati Amrit's pots is made only by mixing the soil based on the quality and pH level of soil after getting it tested in the laboratory. Through collaboration with Amrit Mati India Trust, we are doing research on the health, social, religious and economic importance of earthen pots. Especially with public awareness about the health benefits of earthen utensils. By using modern technology, opportunities for their more usage are also being created in new areas. In this context, we first got the food cooked in earthen pots lab tested from NIBL certified laboratory.It has been proven that if food is cooked in earthen pots, all types of essential nutrients in the food remains safe and the value can be increased up to 4 times as compared to other utensils. After this, water of Alkaline water jug made by Mati Amrit was tested by Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (Department of Hydro and Renewable Energy). In the test, 10 types of water samples taken from alkaline water jug were tested. Result after test:- The Alkaline Water Jug was observed to successfully improve the pH to the acceptable range for drinking water as per the standard specified by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). 11 families were randomly experimented to make and eat food in Mati Amrit's clay product for 3 months. After 3 months, the results tested by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University of Jodhpur under the supervision of Vice Chancellor Mr. Pradeep Prajapati showed that the fasting blood sugar and LDL cholesterol had reduced and HDL cholesterol had increased, which shows that clay utensils helps in reducing Cardiovascular Complications. It also improves sleep cycle and digestion process of all age groups which enhance the quality of life.",

        "description": "Leymens.com is the online e commerce store which deals only in M2B & B2B basis. In leymens.com our teams visit and do market search for the SME and business traders and get them on board. In the project we are initially getting the vendors in women\u2019s fashion textile market. second step is we get the products sample which the vendor is manufacturing and ask them to send it to our warehouse and all the formalities of vendor registration at the time of pickup. later on vendor receive welcome kit in that they receive login id password card with the card then can get the entry in warehouse, store, office and they get visiting card of company, brochure for future plans, welcome letter, security bond ,security cheque for their stock they provided, instruction to use. Stock is always unpaid from the vendor. They are paid for the products which are sold by use we provide the advance payments to the vendors for the sales generated by us for them. They even not have to upload the product starting from photoshoot and promotion of the product till final selling and dispatching are being carried by us. Vendors get the full service by our side in the part of designing and all if they acquire for our paid plans through this we provide employment to the freelancers designer and other photographers and models and each and everyone those who are outsourced for this work Thirdly when stock is received at ware house accounts team get in action they go through all the stock and check the challan received from the vendors storage house or factories. By providing free ware housing service to the vendor we are reducing their cost of having storage house they can place machines in that space and can work easily. After the stock is checked by the inventory and accounts dept. the barcoding and branding is done on each and every product so we can ready up the product for the further processing. By the time QC team start their work and they carry on the process of checking for defects and quality part. One piece each designs is sent for product photoshoot part and we later on provide the edited images to the vendors for their work. Till this face we acquire freelancer photographers and models for the work. Now comes the turn of processing department this processing dept. transfer the photoshoot pieces to store and samples are being displayed in store for physical purchase by the customer . we are planning to open these type of store in every state in main city where there is the clientage of retailers. Product and promotion team start their work with editing and uploading of the product on the website so they start their promotion activities online and offline both. Website working is like sales executives call the retailers and target customers to sign up in the website and start shopping on website customer can have a look on the products and they can have the information of the products except prices. Customer are informed for the the pricing pattern on webside we have placed d.no. and its pricing pattern is d.no divide by 2 is price . Customer can add product to cart then in cart there is just a sum up amount of 500 INR from each and every customer those who are purchasing from the website this amount is referred as booking amount for their purchase the sales executive then forward their proper estimate and after the finalization from the availability of stock the estimates are sent to the customer by using WhatsApp hence we receive their orders forms online from the back end we start processing later on the sales team ask for the payments in company bank account customer can also amend the orders before and after the payment adjustment are to be carried forward by the team and working is completed at the sales process by the team. Company is planning to hire 500 tele sales executive for the activity and space and allotments are required for these type of working. Corporate office is planned at Jaipur only. Further process moves with after receiving the payment from the customers accounts and inventory department coordinately start working with the order form account dept check for the payments and all the orders estimates they take printout currently we are using two software\u2019s for the accounting one is Retail graph for inventory management and another is tally erp9. Inventory dept. packs the order shipment is booked by accounts. Dept and orders get delivered before time till date. The website have special benefits of d.no retailers and reseller can directly send the link of website to their clients and customers because their rates are confidential and they can easily work on the website on the same part. We get the products from the SMEs at the minimum prices and high quality products we define quality by selling we do not require advertisement for the selling because if one clients order from our platform then they get the best services from our side and they become habitual due to unavailability of much funds we are not scaling to different industries and places if we get the funding for this project this project is money spinner and we can get the crores of turnover even in this economically down market stands. We are working this projects from 4 to 5 years but facing the problems we came on the current stage of launching. We require mentoring from I start Rajasthan side and mentors and investors so we can present our project for launch being. Being into this project from the age of 15 I have spent 5 years on the finalization of project and this project is loss proof project. It can go NPNL but never in negative. We can provide as much as employment we want to the unemployed persons even from illiterate to fully educated IIM and IITs can be hired in this project. We request you to please provide a meeting for the better explanation of the project hence we have fully explained this project in words by our side Thanking You",

During this process we felt that the solutions offered are more of decorative and glamour giving, whereas the need of almost every client is utilitarian automation. We pin pointed the missing link and focused on developing devices which are useful in real sense and power saving also. So we developed and protyped the device and proceeding to make it available to the world in commercial terms. Ours is Automation hardware device and a in reply to query, please note: HUMAN PRESENCE: If we talk about Automation, after all it is for human beings. And so automation devices will be effective and of utility only if they could somehow know that a human is present at scene. CURRENT SCENARIO: No such device is commercially available to detect human presence with required precision. Be it PIR sensor, microwave sensor, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor or any other technology based devices. They all have shortcomings. It does not warrant elaboration here anyhow. OUR FOCUS: Being a system installer and integration company basically, we faced this problem and learnt that no such solution is available. We started working on it and reached the prototype stage successfully Technology Used : Passive infrared sensing. Everything in this universe above absolute zero (-273 degree Kelvin scale) emit infrared energy, so do human. And everything or being has a specific range of IR. Is it a new technology : No, it is a very common technology and cheap sensors are readily available. But the problem is that it detects motion only. That\u2019s the reason these are confined to be used in Washrooms, corridor etc. where the person is not expected to STAY. Our Device: Uses PIR sensing with input of our technology and system developed after Intrinsic blend study of Sensors, IOT, Materials , electrical and electronics together with our expertise of practical scenarios of home and commercial Place automation , is able to sense a STAIONARY HUMAN. This makes it suitable (or can say COMPULSORY) for every place Residential or commercial place where automation is required or sought after. Technology : PIR Sensing Availability of Components : EASY Impact on environment : NONE Power Saving : YES, Device own consumption in idle state is less that 60 micro ampere Device Life : 10 YEARS or more Service Requirements : NONE for stand alone Utility : Is for Automation as LATHE is for manufacturing Competition : None Yet, and doesn't appears to be easy. Licensing Requirement to use Any specific component : None Operating Voltage : 5V DC and 220 Volt AC",

We at Nuskha Kitchen want to revive the classic and effective recipes, the nuskhas of Ayurveda once again. To make them a common name for the generations to come. With our products, we wish to direct the urban population towards the benefits of Ayurveda.

Our flagship product the Post-Natal Care Package is a unique, one in class produce. It solves the problem of post-partum diet faced by every expecting mother.

In arid and semi-arid regions, solar panels lose up to 30% of their efficiency due to dust accumulation. Traditional cleaning methods are water-intensive, labor-dependent, and often inconsistent \u2014 especially across large solar fields. Photom addresses this with autonomous, dry-cleaning robots that work without water, require no additional infrastructure, and are compatible with both fixed tilt and seasonal tilt structures. Built with lightweight frames, microfiber helical brushes, and IoT-based monitoring, our patented solution ensures consistent cleaning, reduces O&M costs, and improves energy generation. Since inception, Photom has deployed its technology across 950+ MW at 25+ plants across 6 Indian states, with clients like Stride Climate Investments. We\u2019ve saved over 540 million liters of water and reduced 72,000+ tons of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Photom generates revenue through direct product sales, supported by AMC-based service offerings. We are now expanding our portfolio to include integrated panel inspection systems, smart trackers, and an AI-powered predictive O&M platform \u2014 moving toward our vision of building the intelligent infrastructure backbone for solar energy\u2019s future.",

Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AugnaAR will provide solutions in many sectors such as: Education, Real estate, e-commerce, industry and manufacturing etc. Starting with the education sector, AugnaAR introduces the first product named MentAR. MentAR is an application which is designed for the needs of all i.e., a teacher, a student, a professor, etc. In this pandemic time students are not able to study at any institute, the private school\u2019s tuition fees are more so parents are shifting their children to government schools, but we all know that government school teachers are less preferred over private ones. Even the private ones have to teach online, which is difficult to do so because explaining the same without being physical is problematic. Because of the above reasons and great visual effects more and more students are preferring online educating services like, Vedantu, Byju\u2019s etc. Even after doing so, students are not satisfied, they say that the importance of physical teacher cannot be replaced whether it be smart classes or online education services. Here comes the MentAR, which acts as a bridge between the conventional teaching and modern teaching. MentAR is designed such that: A teacher can increase his/her teaching skills through great visual effects. A student can understand everything by referring the textbook as it mostly covers the syllabus. Apart from the syllabus some basic knowledge is visualized. It is useful even after the pandemic when everyone starts joining schools physically.",

Moreover, in the age of digitization and this pandemic, it\u2019s important to promote paperless and contact-less services. As medical industry is growing with increasing corporate hospital chains and growing number of doctors, the major issue still remains for safekeeping of medical reports which are extremely personal to a person. To solve this problem our application provides a safe vault/locker where patient can store his/her medical records safely. None of the current system aims to provide a platform to safely secure these medical records and prescriptions and it certainly has a huge potential in it. MedeeSmart will provide a platform to the users to book doctor\u2019s appointments in a personalized manner. It will provide filters to give a more personalized view to the user. The said filters will include a rating filter and a fees filter, so that the user can view the doctor in their price range and the expected ratings.

They will save their time, cost and risk during transportation(accidental damage) . (d)Selling Market for Farmers -AGI will buy the Organic products from farmers. It will help the farmers to set an example for others because farmers are interested to go for ORGANIC farming but they don\u2019t have end users those con buy from them.

        "description": "Problem Our Startup is solving - Students, at times, lack the resources & support to prepare for the pressure faced while appearing for competitive exams. Specially when a student is preparing for descriptive(written) exam, teachers are hard to find, who can evaluate student's answer sheet and give them marks. Student is often put in a position to self evaluate him/herself. The learning is very slow in such cases. While there are experts available, there is no medium/platform which can connect them to needy students at the right time and at right cost. How does our startup propose to solve this problem - We aim to simulate real exam environment by providing a platform: 1. with huge no. of students competing at the same time, i.e. (preparing students for real pressure) 2. with personalized feedback services by subject experts, i.e. (helping students improve their exam scores) At StepFly, we have multiple mock tests which user can attempt and submit their answer sheet. We at StepFly get it evaluated by our subject experts and give evaluated answer sheet back to students. This entire process is automated. Uniqueness of the solution - Personalized feedback and marks (evaluated answer sheet by subject expert) of user is fed into the app by StepFly team. It actually merges online practice performance (content practiced within the app) and offline practice performance of user. Subject experts can deliver their services through the platform directly to needy students. Opportunities are matched with experts using algorithms developed by StepFly based on: 1. Expert's knowledge level 2. Time limit for delivering a user specific service 3. Expert's past record of delivering service on StepFly",

A rider can create a ride by mentioning relevant details such as source, destination, date and departure time of ride. We suggest these rides to most suited drivers using our AI-based ride recommendation algorithm. BidRyd drivers get the personalized ride feed (similar to how Facebook shows personalized news feed), which can help them to earn big profits. Drivers can also manually search for the rides available in a neighborhood. Driver can choose any ride that they like and can make a bid for it. Riders can see top bids on their ride anytime. Riders will be informed whenever the lowest bid changes on their ride. Riders can choose a suitable driver with reasonable price and book their ride by making an advance payment if required. BidRyd charges a 10% commission to drivers if monthly revenue is less than 30K and 15% for the revenue above than 30K. BidRyd recommendation engine recommends most profitable rides to drivers. Suppose a driver has a booked ride from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019 then recommendation will suggest rides originating from B\u2019s neighborhood to \u2018A\u2019.",

We've started our operations in the beta phase in December and already delivered to 700+ eco-conscious customers. In Packaging our vendor's also nature conscious and they use minimal packaging and that too eco friendly, without plastic and harmful adhesive free. All the products, packaging are 100% Bio-Degradable, 100% natural, and handmade. We are also working on eco-packaging so the next time when you throw that packaging that will grow in beautiful flower plants and also you can convert it to make bird nests. When customers run out of any product i.e shampoo they can refill and get a discount so they don't need to throw empty glass bottles. The idea is to encourage people to go for a zero-waste lifestyle that focuses on reduce and reuse. By 2022 we are planning to open 8 physical stores in the metro cities, based on the Franchise model, all of our physical stores will run on clean energy and also users can directly visit the stores for a refill. The team working behind the project are also passionate nature lovers, Naman Sharma founder of this project has worked with many Rajasthan-based startups and actively educating people about the zero-waste lifestyle for 2 years. Currently, we are working with 7 people who are handling important aspects of web design, graphics, content, and Brand and PR. Rajasthan is home to many leading startups, while Rajasthan is already leading in clean energy and having amazing rooted culture, we also want Rajasthan should lead a sustainable lifestyle. This startup will not only creates a job for the locals but also can become an inspiration to our future generations because unlike traditional marketing we'll be educating people with creative acts, school and college seminars, meetups, and collective events like cleanups and plantations.

        "description": "In today\u2019s scenario school transportation lacks a robust and secure system for student management. GPS is not enough to track students. It only tracks buses, not the students inside it. Schools and Parents face significant barriers to choose school transportation and entry/exit solutions for its inadequate information and lack of quality options. We believe the existing system is not enough for safety and tracking of students. Not any more, it\u2019s high time for us to dramatically reshape school transport priorities and needs. There were many cases reported in the recent years wherein many school students were found to be missing and abducted in India. In India, an estimated 96,000 children go missing each year - Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Missing Children of India. As per the Report published by Statista Research Department, In 2021, there were over 101 thousand kidnapping and abduction cases reported in India. The leading reason for this crime was missing children deemed as kidnapped with over 28 thousand cases that year. Therefore, considering the above reports and security needs for the benefit of schools, parents and students, we have designed a unique security system so as to keep the full track of the students and provide information on real time basis to their parents. This helps to avoid any panic situation for schools/transporters/parents. We understand that \u201cEvery child in the class is someone\u2019s whole world.\u201d We believe in keeping the students safe and promoting social and creative learning. The safety of students on campus has become a high priority in many countries. We believe school tracking system is a delicate balance of maintaining a free, open, welcoming, creative and educational atmosphere while still offering a secure location for students to learn and ease parent's worries. We believe safety in schools is necessary to support the academic success of each student, giving them the opportunity to learn and achieve in a safe and nurturing environment.",

The prime idea behind this invention is - When our sweat evaporates from our body we feel cool. In this Green AC we are first using a Polymer Coated very thin membrane (This technology basically needs to be patented).The Air is first dehumidified through this membrane ,where Water will be separated from the Humid air and the left ever dry air will be passed through Evaporative cooling. The water is separated from the Humid air is as pure as RO water and can be used for drinking purpose. The dry air passing through evaporative cooling system will give exactly same cooling what we get through conventional Air Conditioners. This technology will save the environment from getting heated,it's environment friendly,will saves electricity charges as we are not using any sort of Compressor or any harmful gases. Even the cost of this Green AC will be almost 40% less than that of conventional Air Conditioning systems which makes it affordable for almost every section of the society. During Pilot we have plans to use solar power for our Green AC in ambition to provide a cooking systems for every home in almost negligible cost. We have plans to set up manufacturing unit in Rajasthan and our prime source of revenue would be direct selling to customers. We can even go for building a Franchise network all over India to make the reach as much as we can.

Amount will be transferred to their accounts each and every time until and unless they are getting orders of the designs they made. There are many underprivileged kids and under rated artist that needs a recognition and a platform to earn. and there are many customers that want their t shirts to have a story behind it. I mean they want their t-shirts that has some meaning. So as I said the biggest problem is the artists are not getting what they deserve. Because there is not a single platform that can give artists a lifetime recurring income and as we added underprivileged children's arts also so we all know it's hard for them to show their talent and earn from it and they want to unleash their talent and express themselves and earn a good lifetime income. Customers will get the t-shirts with the stories as they are crafted by our artists that has a story behind every art. and Artists will get the payout even to their nominees after them. From artists point of view they will get a lifetime payout for their arts instead of getting paid only one time for a art. From Underprivileged children point of view if they are earning payouts from their art, it can help in their personal development, education, it can improve their living standards and their art could also get recognized worldwide.",

As technology is advancing day by day, agriculture will also be the biggest beneficiary of this, but few important issues - 1 . Equipment and Farm Planning - As farms are getting small and, it is important to plan the equipment usage to increase the efficiency and working hours of the equipment. 2. Finance - In rural India, farmers usually do not pay instantly for the service they use, as they promise to pay the amount after selling crops in mandi, this problem has a dual effect as it increases the task for machine owner to collect money from all the farmers he worked for and this also leads to decrease in quality of work done by machine owner as he knows this farmer is going to pay me late or less and ultimately this decreases the production. 3. Unorganized 2nd Hand Equipment trading market - As farms are getting smaller, farmers prefer to buy used equipment instead of new ones and this is opening up immense opportunities for an organized player in the market which can fulfill the trade of used equipment between farmers transparently. We have made our App after understanding the problem regarding agriculture equipment renting and trading, and after meeting and discussing with 100's farmers we have found various problems that need to be solved with an empathetic approach. Our App offer solution to these problems - 1.We are integrating a use-now pay-later service where farmers can pay the machine owner's rent instantly from our app and can pay us later after 30-45 days interest-free. 2.Our AI-based equipment planner helps the equipment owner to plan the equipment work, send reminder to farmers about payment and let farmers book equipment in advance and rate the work of the mach owner. 3.

Our mission at HotelRozgar is to aid this talented workforce by providing them access to our technology platform, as we firmly believe that talent without smart work is futile. We have specifically targeted the core departments of Food Production, F&B Service, Front Office, and Housekeeping in hotels. By utilizing our technology, operations, and marketing expertise, we are creating an ecosystem in which hospitality staff, agents, and hoteliers can easily find and post job requirements. Our platform includes an android application and a website that both staff and hoteliers can use to apply for and locate jobs. (New improved website and android application is currently under development and will be launched by the third week of March 2023.) Our platform caters to the local workforce using Hindi and English languages, and we plan to include other local languages in future releases. We strive to provide equal opportunities for everyone in the industry, enabling hotel workers to find jobs using simple and easy-to-use technology similar to other industry jobs. The high attrition rate in the industry leads to additional costs for staff and hiring teams, and we aim to bridge the gap. We have some unique differentiators that set us apart from others, including being the first app and website serving all categories of hospitality industry workers, being written in local languages to improve communication, using geolocation to identify nearby job opportunities, providing a personalized experience by including a contact number on every screen, providing assistance to those still working in the daily wage economy, offering training for freshers and skill development for experienced staff, serving servers in a smart and hassle-free manner, and reducing the efforts of young entrepreneurs who wish to start hospitality-related businesses.",

We developed an Eco-Friendly Water Retention Natural Polymer named \"Fasal Amrit\" which is able to absorb 300 times more water than its own weight for as long as 10-12 days. It helps to reduce irrigation water requirement by 30-40% along with a 40-50% reduction in fertilizer because it prevents the leaching of fertilizer causes 10-20% fertilizer loss. The \"Fasal Amrit\" itself is made from organic waste hence it has a great number of micronutrients to support the better growth of crop/plant. It is totally organic in nature, chemical-free, pollution-free, and what is interesting, it is 100% biodegradable in the soil after 5-6 months of application. The farmers can reduce their cost of water and fertilizer by 20-40% and can increase the yield by 10-20%. The application of \"Fasal Amrit\" is including but is not limited to in-house plants to save them for a week or two in case you are not at your home to water them, keep your garden green forever by reducing the daily watering cycle, enhance the growth of your plant in an organic way, save your plant far from your home or on hilly areas where it is difficult for your water them daily, etc.",

It is also into Machine Learning and Computer Vision-based AR apps for industry-specific solutions. The problem we are solving: We are creating virtual experiences for the people to experience any product, venue, event, or leisure without having to displace themselves. VR helps in connecting people with the environment by teleporting them into the product itself, which can be a car, apartment, adventure park, country, or anything. How does our startup proposes to solve the problem: We are leveraging the use of VR devices and creating an experience through technology on and off campus which is then fine-tuned and made available for everyone to dive into a new world. The uniqueness: We are using state-of-the-art devices and technologies to produce the highest level of visual experiences. The domain which we're unaware of using VR is now being shown, with our solutions, how to put it to use. Our solutions are immersive and visually more appealing where a user finds himself a part of the experience, compared to conventional methods where there's a disconnect. Revenue generation: We are service providers and hence we charge for our services. That is the main source of revenue generation. We are also coming up with a subscription model for a product that is under development. The problem we are solving: We are a virtual reality company mainly focused on creating experiences that take the breath away.

The complete ecosystem is based on advanced research and environment sustainable processes. 1. Mini Mines has its own IP-protected technology and proprietary closed-loop method. This environmentally clean approach, without any harmful emissions, caters to the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) towards carbon neutrality. 2. Mini Mines proprietary process reproduces battery-grade materials of lithium, cobalt, magnesium, nickel for re-entry into the supply chain required for Li-ion cell manufacturing. This will create an indigenous supply of raw materials and will reduce the foreign dependency for sourcing of the raw materials. Innovation: The hydrometallurgy process mainly involves preparing an aqueous solution of a salt of the metal and recovering the metal from the solution. The operations usually involved are leaching, or dissolution of the metal or metal compound in water, commonly with additional agents; separation of the waste and purification of the leach solution; and the precipitation of the metal or one of its pure compounds from the leach solution by chemical or electrolytic means. The most common leaching agent is dilute sulfuric acid. These extracted compounds are then further purified for end-use applications. This process gives an extraction efficiency of more than 90%.",

        "description": "Rehab Buddy works on the problem statement of an unbalanced ratio between multidisciplinary rehabilitation services demand and supply. COVID 19 pandemic suddenly raised the demand for rehabilitation services as people are suffering from various mental conditions (anxiety, depression, mood disorder & others) neurological (PIVD, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s & others) respiratory due to COVID, orthopedic (fracture, dislocations, back pain & others) and pediatric conditions have a sudden increase in number (Autism, ASD, ADHD, learning disability, behavioral issues) which require various rehabilitation services to secure a good quality of life and independent activities of daily living. In India research shows that psychiatric and pediatric cases are increasing and getting worse due to irregular rehabilitation therapies. The factors responsible for such conditions are - Lack of time, feasibility & conveyance for patient (client) / caregivers. Lack of rehab professionals & accessibility to multidisciplinary rehab services. No specialized patient growth monitoring system in rehab services. Lack of education & awareness among clients and patients. Unable to receive regular rehab therapy treatment. Lack of market and awareness of therapeutic tools & devices. The solution is Multidisciplinary Tele-rehabilitation providing occupational therapy, physiotherapy, clinical psychology, and special education services by an easily accessible mobile application including a patient\u2019s monitoring system, automated progress report, regular self-assessments, tailored home treatment plan by professional, notification for activity & exercise to patient and caregiver followed by checklist. 200+ demonstration videos for various diseases, syndromes & conditions & tele- therapy sessions through video calls, audio calls, and chat. It also consists of an E-store for therapeutic tools & equipment for feasible purchase as per recommendation by professionals.",

These hospitals constitute 70%-85% of the total number of hospitals in India, affecting over 80% of the Indian population. Even today, in order to provide treatment to their patients, hospitals have to cold call doctors which is an inefficient method as it consumes a lot of time and then too the response rates are quite low. As a result, patients have to travel long distances, especially those requiring immediate care like obstetrics, orthopaedics, paediatrics etc. This increases the expenses drastically for the patients as they have to pay for the transportation, food and accommodation apart from the medical expenses.",

Properties that make them suitable include high yielding ability, high pulping quality, good adaptation to prevailing climatic conditions and low-cost. Non wood biomass pulping plays a vital role in pulp supply and regional agricultural residue utilization . These materials are environmentally friendly, cheap and have a vast availability that can meet the demand and consumption of paper in an economy without competing with food and land. In today\u2019s time the pre-existing techniques have many flaws which need to be improved by gradual experimentations, also the conventional process is not applicable, as Silica and Ash content of straws and by-products are high. Lignocellulosic Biomass is basically made up of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, Silica and Ash which further after treatment can be extracted and converted into various different products. The type of method used usually influences the products formed and their yield along with the various by-products formed to a great extent. The aim of our process has been to maximize yields of fractions with high purity to make quality that can sustain market standards along with environmental care. The developed process is closed loop, which not only saves energy by utilising its complex chemistry but also recycles the reagents that do not require inputs except raw material after start. The Products are recovered and converted into finished products. For eg. The cellulose streams are converted into paper and lignin can be added to coatings and adhesives. We would have two main sources of revenue out of which the primary source would be product sales, then in form of royalty for transfer technology to interested parties.",

Keeping this in mind we are diversifying to a made-to-order format that fulfils our initial vision of keeping it local and adding culture to our city.

Food innovation is the need of the hour to inculcate nutrition value in diet of Indian food. The last such grain that grew recognition in India and worldwide was oats which people have started to believe is a healthy choice. What supergrain we are offering has more nutritious value than oats. \"Spent grain\" is a massively overlooked potential source of human nutrition that accounts for 85% of the brewing industry\u2019s byproducts. Think of it similarly to how whey protein is produced as the cheese industry's primary byproduct. Spent Grain is considered a rich source of fiber, protein, and phenolic compounds. 95 percent of Indians don\u2019t meet their daily fibre requirement. If you make a list of top 10 foods with high fibre the highest would be chia seeds with 34g fibre per 100g. Aged and Baked spent grain flour consists of more than 50 percent fibre.We plan to develop an ecosystem around it with other lined up products such as protein chips, protein bread, ready to eat items and want to leverage spent grain in all this.",

        "description": "Alniya Rajeevika Mahila Sarvangin Vikas Sahkari Samiti started the production of its wide range of products post Covid-19. The pandemic affected economies worldwide, with poor and marginalised women being among the hardest hit. The founders of Alniya, Ms Sangeeta Goud, Ms Bisha Devi and Ms Nilesh Singh hailing from Keval Nagar, Kota were among those finding it difficult to generate income in the post-covid world. However, guided by their entrepreneurial drive along with assistance from Rajeevika, they began the manufacture of handmade personal care products and cleaning agents such as soaps, handwash, detergents and so on. They were able to sell enough products to make a living and now plan to extend that opportunity to 30 other women like them through the scaling up of operations, providing a much needed alternative source of livelihood for rural women. Giving these women the opportunity to earn a living to support themselves and their families lies at the core of Alniya's business endeavours. Therefore, funding provided to Alinya would not only amount to an investment in their excellent hand-crafted products but also the potential of rural women. The cooperative would also benefit tremendously from having the opportunity to consult with mentors who have considerable expertise in creating and sustaining successful businesses whether it is in terms of market research, the scaling up of operations or marketing in order to reach as many customers as possible. It is our belief that funding and mentorship that can be provided by an initiative like iStart is what Alniya requires in order to offer an opportunity for sufficient income generation and a secure future for many more rural women and their families.",

Having over 38 traditional art forms plus 6 modern theatrical forms in more than 22 languages across the country, India is unquestionably the richest treasury of performing arts. Despite theatre being one of the strongest pillars of India's past, the popularity of the art form is somewhat fading away with time. Herein lies an economic void that can be and needs to be filled. We, the Theatre Management Company, are an organization striving to build a stronger theatre community in India. We have created a One-stop solution platform that will act as an assistant for all the theatre professionals out there, making the theatre-making process easy with its 4 key features: I. List your play details online: - Listing all the details of the play online will make it accessible to use anytime for its director, theatre festival, and event organizers as a separate URL of each play will be attained after listing, leading to the ONE-CLICK availability of the play details. II. List your profile: - All the theatre professionals across India, from producers, and directors, 28+ different categories of writers, and 48+ different categories of musicians to backstage artists to carpenters, everyone can list their profiles on this platform creating a wider network to expand their resources in creativity. III. Giveaway feature: -The website provides this feature to list the unnecessary articles in our homes to help the artists save money in purchasing them. - Giveaways will help generate trust amongst the theatre community which is an important virtue in our lives. IV. Scripts: - The content availability of plays, poems, and stories in multiple languages all in one place. Foreseeing the massive opportunity to be a part of the 'Much-needed' transition in Indian Theatre, we wish to execute our solutions in every corner of India.",

Our services cater to both B2B and B2C markets, and we provide a wide range of study materials, including PPTs, QA, MCQ, previous year QAs, solved QAs, Mindmaps, Animations, and Graphics Designing for content, translation, transcription, AR/VR, Digital Design, AI, Data Science, and STEM-labs. As you are aware, quality teachers are scarce in the education industry, and this poses a significant challenge to small schools, Hindi medium schools, and local language-supported schools in 2nd and 3rd tier cities and villages. These schools often cannot afford big salaries and faculty training programs, resulting in students missing out on new technologies and study materials. Our startup addresses this challenge by providing video classes, live classes, and high-quality content for study. We have established STEM-labs in various schools, and we offer live classes and content to various education industries. Our team of experts is well-versed in this technology and is dedicated to providing personalized and affordable solutions to our clients. At Mindmap Digitech LLP, we understand the importance of quality education and are committed to leveraging technology to make education accessible to all. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the education industry and technology, and we strive to make learning an enjoyable and interactive experience for students. We would love the opportunity to collaborate with you and provide our services to meet your needs. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.",

By providing a self-help tool that enables indigent individuals to generate relevant legal documents in a matter of minutes, we can increase the efficiency of pro bono work and improve access to justice for those in need.Overall, our solution is driven by a desire to address the challenges faced by indigent individuals in accessing legal aid services in India and contribute towards the larger goal of promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions.",

Internet connects the business to the world but also exposes it to cyber attacks and network issues. Hence, it is imperative for any business to have a firewall and some sort of network management system. However, we see that only big businesses can afford to install and maintain firewalls because of the high CapEx and OpEx. All businesses do not have capacity to first buy expensive hardware and then hire workforce to configure and maintain this hardware. We solve this problem by providing businesses a subscription based firewall which is managed by our engineers remotely. Here, businesses have to invest zero on CapEx and very less on OpEx as our subscriptions are very affordable depending on the number of services opted by the customer. Our Firewall solution can replace existing Firewall Equipments like Fortinet, Sophos, Checkpoint etc. to provide customers all the services provided by these devices like: DDoS attack mitigation, Firewall (basic/advance), VPN, SD-WAN, Tunneling Services with IPSec, Bandwidth Management, WAN balancing, Load balancing etc. There is no licensing fees and no long term commitments. First we audit the customer requirement and accordingly suggest best possible service package. Doing so, we would be able to bring maximum number of businesses behind firewall protection which will be very affordable. As this firewall will be managed by our engineers, customers automatically get best Network Management with least amount of downtime, which in turn increases productivity.",

However, with the increasing demand for senior AI professionals, now even senior IT executives are keen to learn AI. However, the needs of senior professionals are different from the students. Students and junior professionals need to go deep, they need to do more hands-on and master the technology while Senior professionals need to go wide. Apart from understanding the technical part of AI, they also need to know the management part, like - security concerns, regulations, how to build an AI team, the costs involved, real use cases of AI in businesses etc. The major problems with most existing AI courses are - Do not cover the latest topics like Generative AI, Large Language Models, LLM Agents etc. - Long duration: 6 months to 2 years - Do not cover management topics like - AI/ LLM Security, How to build AI teams, Regulations in AI, Real use cases of AI in businesses etc. We have designed an AI-enabled educational platform keeping the needs of senior professionals in mind.

Our mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of thinkers, innovators, and problem-solvers by providing accessible and engaging learning experiences in STEM fields. Problem Statement: The significant discrepancy between theoretical knowledge acquisition and the development of practical skills in the educational system, which is especially noticeable in the field of STEM education. The vital problem-solving abilities and innovative attitude that today's technologically advanced society demands are not fostered by traditional education approaches, which rely mostly on memory and theoretical learning. The lack of qualified STEM teachers and the high price of teaching materials increase this problem by preventing schools with tight budgets from obtaining them. As a result, students lose out on important chances to investigate cutting-edge trends and technology, which leaves them unprepared for the fast-paced employment market. Solution: Our company provides a comprehensive solution designed for Grades 1\u201310 to revolutionize STEM education delivery. To promote engaging education in the classroom, we provide robotics kits as well as custom computer coding and artificial intelligence curriculum.

It will also help in rural development, which is our real Bharat. We will help rural students to get the best career options after 12th as per their profile and future goals. Because there is a huge gap in this area. As most of the companies are not going to rural areas physically and very few people are going to rural areas, i.e. only for one day seminar in schools, but what after that? Nobody is thinking about it. We will open a small shop-type office in that village so that students and their parents can easily contact us. Also, the owner of that office will be a local of the same area. He will get proper career counseling training so that he has first-hand experience. This will give him a business opportunity and it will help in generating employment in the rural sector. Apart from this, we will also include things like offline skills and training sessions in rural areas. We will work together with top edtech companies and universities so that students can get the best career options at one place. Also the companies will get students from us. So it will help create an ecosystem for both of us. The Problems:- * Lack of Consistent Career Guidance in Rural India: Most career seminars in villages are one-day events with no follow-up support. * Limited Access to Information: Rural students and their parents are unaware of modern career paths and scholarship opportunities. * Unemployment and Underemployment: Many rural youths choose the wrong career paths due to lack of guidance. Our Solution:- * Local Career Guidance Hubs: Physical offices operated by trained locals in their villages. * Ongoing Support: Year-round counseling, college guidance, scholarships, EdTech onboarding. * Parent Engagement: Workshops and interactive sessions with families. * EdTech & University Partnerships: One-stop access to college options, test prep, and all.",

When a vehicle travels at a high speed over the Oobleck, it behaves like a solid, slowing the vehicle down. However, when a vehicle travels at a lower speed, it acts like a liquid, providing a smoother and more comfortable ride. Advantages: Reduced Damage: Oobleck speed breakers are designed to minimize damage to vehicles, especially when they are traveling at lower speeds, says an article in IRJET. Comfort: They provide a smoother ride for vehicles traveling at appropriate speeds, unlike traditional speed bumps that can be jarring. Cost-Effective: The cost of manufacturing and installing Oobleck speed breakers is generally lower than traditional concrete or asphalt speed bumps,",

A person can survive for days without food, but not without water. In India, the mineral water bottle market is currently valued at USD 9.5 billion and is growing at an impressive annual rate of 12.5%. At this pace, the market is projected to reach USD 29.7 billion by 2030. Currently, only 30% of this market is organized, while the remaining 70% remains unorganized. This significant market gap presents a powerful opportunity \u2014 and this is where my startup, \"We Pure\", comes in. Just like popular brands such as Amul and Havmor sell their ice creams through mobile ice cream carts, \"We Pure\" will distribute clean, affordable mineral water through specially designed water carts. Our offering: 1-liter mineral water bottles priced at just \u20b915, ensuring both affordability and quality for the masses. Our initial focus will be on high-footfall areas such as bus depots and railway stations, where more than 50 million people travel daily by bus and over 1.2 million people use trains every day. This is a high-potential niche market with tremendous demand, yet a lack of organized and accessible supply. I strongly believe that \"We Pure\"has the potential to become a revolutionary solution in the mineral water segment and achieve rapid growth in the coming years. I invite you to join us in bringing this vision to life. \"At present, Indian Railways generates an annual revenue of approximately \u20b9350 crore solely from the sale of packaged drinking water under its Rail Neer brand. In a similar domain, my startup is developing a wide-reaching distribution network that aims to ensure the availability of bottled water at most bus terminals across India \u2014 particularly in Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 cities. Through this expansion, it is estimated that around 3,000 jobs will be created, which will not only generate new local employment opportunities.",

The challenges we seek to solve include: 1. Quality and Nutrition: Most street food lacks basic nutritional value and often uses heavily processed ingredients. 2. Waste and Environmental Impact: A large volume of single-use, plastic-coated disposables leads to serious issues \u2014 harming animals, reducing soil health, and contributing to larger environmental and public health challenges. 3. Vendor Livelihoods: Many street vendors are untrained, underpaid (in relative terms), overworked, and often lack access to better products or professional growth opportunities. Our Approach: We are creating mini-cafes and nutritious carts designed to serve \"choti bhukh\" snacks and drinks that meet four essential standards: i. Tastes Amazing \u2014 Every product is crafted to be truly enjoyable. ii. Good for You \u2014 Made without refined or processed ingredients; rooted in natural nutrition. iii. Feels Familiar \u2014 Recipes built around traditional, comforting flavors. iv. Affordable \u2014 Fairly priced to stay accessible to everyone. Beyond Food: Our model also addresses broader social and environmental challenges by: - Introducing hyperlocal composting solutions to manage organic waste. - Using technology innovations to eliminate single-use disposable practices. - Offer a pre-incubation space which ignites entrepreneurship curiosity amongst youth. Our First Step: We have opened a mini-breakfast caf\u00e9 \u2014 BeBarfi Startup Caf\u00e9 \u2014 https://g.co/kgs/ogVvGB3 Located in Jaipur, the caf\u00e9 operates between 6:30 AM and 11:00 AM.",
